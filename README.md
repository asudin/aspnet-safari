> The aspnet-safari project is a game based on the 'Dwarf Fortress' that is made on ASP.NET Core and utilizes web API with Blazor web assembly app as a frontend. The project was made as a final task on the .NET developer internship during summer 20203. The aim of the project was to get comfortable with creating a full scaled project from scratch and using web API's to make request calls, while providing some minimal work on a front-end of choice (MVC or Blazor.app). The Blazor.app was chosen over an MVC as the project was simple enough for the processing power to be on the client side, as well as to get familiar with Blazor.

> The animals in the Safari game simulate a natural behavior, where they are separated into two main categories (hunters and preys). They move, they hunt, they escape and most importantly they give birth to new animals. The user has the ability to enable a new animal manually or to create new animals and import them in a project as a simple .DLL file.
